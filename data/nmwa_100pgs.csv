Thanks for reading that interview. I've recently started cuffing my trousers having found a tailor who can do it to my satisfaction on OTR trousers and having MTM trouser makers who can make some adjustments needed to deal with teh bow leg (I was worried about ""puddling"" due to the way trousers break for me at the hem since they don't come in straight down). 

1.75 inch cuffs here. That said, I have many uncuffed trousers. Nothing wrong with mixing things up a bit.

Is there a difference in washed versus unwashed linen that can cause a knit to fit differently? I have experienced multiple inconsistencies now with the linen Pub Jacket. I picked up the Ardee in SS16 and cannot find another Pub Jacket, same size, whether the same season or this season, that fits the same. I had to size up on another Pub Jacket but it has been relegated to more casual wear rather than regular wear. Another thing is I noticed on my Ardee that the collar does not roll up on the back but lies flat (e.g. against your shirt collar). The collar is much more springy. If you take a look at other places carrying this season's Pub Jacket and observe the back collar, it rolls up. Does IM have a different method of knitting its Pub Jacket collars? I much prefer the former, it lends itself to a more comfortable and flattering fit IME. I don't know if you will have a chance to visit IM but these have been some of my observations and has brought about some frustrations with the brand. And if it was not for the inconsistencies I probably would sink more money into the brand, participate in more pre-orders, etc. I like the linen knits very much so hopefully this translates into more of a feedback that IM can provide more clarity on.",

I've now had my sister and one of my female buddies ask to borrow it.  There was also a moment where said female buddy and a couple of friends rifled through the internet to find out where I bought it and - more importantly to them - how much I paid.

I broke it out for the first time at an anime convention. I'd normally hide the Mt. Fuji print but at an environment like that, it just felt right to have Fuji-san out and about.

I try to buy as much stuff as I can at retail so that I can take advantage of returns when needed and b/c I'm aware that 50% off retail isn't sustainable for any business (unless you're selling $895 t -shirts). That said, sometimes I just don't have the funds to buy it all in season and there are sale items I would gladly pay at least half or maybe both ends of shipping on in order to try on and return if needed.  I can see how this might be an operational headache to setup online and manage but if you haven't heard that from any customers yet I figured it's worth a mention.",
gdl203,"Jun 28, 2017",7:38 AM,8904340,"It isn't about operational headaches - it's about time running out.   If you buy something on sale in July, return it in August, there's no more time to sell it in the season.   End of season sales are meant to finish selling seasonal goods before the season is gone.

Remember that we do promotions during the season at nice discounts and allowing returns, because there is time. 

When end-of-season sales start, the time to ""try on and return"" has passed.  There's plenty of time before that to ""try on and return""

If we were like Yoox or other off-price retailers, we'd buy our merchandise so low and out-of-season anyway, that there would be both margin and time to accept returns.   So the Yoox roulette shopping strategy is really best reserved for, well, Yoox.",11.0

I'm ordering 44s in 3, 2, 1...

For future ref, I'm a US10.5/UK9.5 in most things but my right foot is jut a tad large across the fore, making it like a 10.7.  In some shoes/lasts it matters, in others it doesn't; it does here.  Also note that these don't have a little stretchy panel where the side and the front connect  If they did, I think my plan would have worked.

My input - unless you're certain your feet are small for their listed size, go with the standard sizing.

Unless it's some straightforward changes (more or less length, more or less waist suppression / shoulder width), we only do MTM in person.    Obviously mismatched sizes and most styling details are things that are easily done.

Do you expect us to sell FW14 items in spring 2017 because we never stop to offer returns and merchandise keeps coming back?

Well I didn't get any notification of the last sale or I would have, apparently I missed it.  It's fine though, you just have to accept that you can't please everyone 100% of the time, I have to deal with the same constraints as well in what I do.

It depends on how close the non garment-dyed ones fit you.  I'd estimate about a half-size difference in fit, typically.   For some people, it means sizing up, but not for others.  


lagsun said:

Not as part of pre-orders.   We're sticking with our two house styles for pre-orders.  

Anything else would have to be an MTM order, handled separately, and a little more expensive than pre-orders.",
gdl203,"Jul 6, 2017",7:25 AM,8911693,"ROTA S/S'18 PRE-ORDERS

It's that time again.   For next spring, we put together our largest range of options for Rota pre-orders ever.

Here's that opportunity to order your size and in a color you want.   This time, we're showing a greater range of colors for each fabric quality, including a lot we won't be carrying off the rack - to give greater choice to those who know their Rota size and are interested in more fabric options.

Like before, we are offering two cut options:  regular mid-rise with belt loops and the style that we developed with Rota with higher rise and side tabs.

Both of our house styles are flat front but, like last fall, we can also accommodate single-pleat requests (regular, not forward) for either style (just indicate in the gift message).    If you think you need an odd size (e.g. 53) please select the closest size and indicate your odd size request in the gift message box.

Code PREORDER15 will give 15% off at checkout.

Note that this is not MTO or MTM : we're not taking orders with sizing modifications, different zippers, etc... only standard sizes in two models.

All the information and swatches can be found here:
http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/pre-orders.html
(note that there are two different product pages for mid-rise and high-rise styles)

Lightweight fresco wool - a NoMan classic from our first summer season








High performance / Travel S120 wool - highly recommended by the Rota family, strong positive customer feedback, travels really well






Patterned lightweight wool - for those looking for a little more pattern, same weight and crunchy texture











Navy nailhead S110 wool - beautiful color and great hand











Wool, silk, linen mix (solids) - a NoMan and customer favorite for spring/summer, fantastic fabric with great character







Wool, silk, linen (Glenplaids and checks) - some new variations on the magic WSL fabric mix















Irish linen - must-have for any wardrobe.







Cotton twill (not garment-dyed) - always the most comfortable option for dress trousers







Cotton seersucker - Note that the swatch is pre-wash, so doesn't rumple quite as much as the end product does






Light Egyptian cotton - a lighter cotton for those truly warm days. For those whose office environments are not quite ready for linen pants!







Garment-dyed cotton/linen - Great ""streaky"" texture. Adding more colors and a white option this season (how did we not have white in the past?!!)
(note that only the large swatch has the correct weave/texture - other swatches are there just for color)

The rise of Rota pants does not increase proportionately to the size, so the large sizes do not have a high rise at all.  Size 54 and above all have rises of less than 11.4"".  Normal rise on a size 56 pant is about 12"", so on the large sizes they are actually medium to low rise.",

The rise does increase with sizes.

Like I said above, ""high"" rise is a subjective matter.  So is the concept of ""normal"" rise by the way.

What do you mean by that?  The color, the hand?   Maybe you mean that it's not garment-dyed (like most chinos are)?

That particular style with the side tabs and in cream is IMO very much on the dress side of things - I would agree.   But the fabric itself, let's say in army green and with belt loops, would also work well for business casual looks.

gdl203,"Jul 12, 2017",10:46 AM,8917301,"VALSTAR PRE-ORDERS SS18

(1) Suede Valstarino

No need to introduce the Valstarino blouson. Invented by Valstar in 1935 as a civilian/city take on A1 military leather jackets, it has been copied, imitated and made all over the world. It's a great piece that can be worn with tailored pants, jeans, a sweater, a shirt. It just looks great on most people. The simple lined version (not wool lining or insulation/fill) is perfect for all climates, including milder ones. The unlined version is perfect when looking for a lighter suede jacket. 

Choose lined or unlined.
Pick your color and size and get it at a great pre-order price.

 


Six colors, sizes from Eu 44 to Eu 60. No MTM or other customization.

 


(2) Cotton/nylon (60/40 type) Valstarino

Finally a fabric Valstarino from the new team at Valstar. Great pick with the 60/40 fabric, water-repellent, same fit and design as Valstarinos, same horn buttons, lighter weight travel fabric and a great value. Three colors available for pre-orders.
http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/inde...ce-cotton-nylon-fabric-valstarino-jacket.html









(3) Cotton/nylon (60/40 type) Trench

Same fabric but cut as a classic short trench. A very useful piece throughout the year. Nice suede detail under the collar.
http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/inde...e-cotton-nylon-fabric-milano-trench-coat.html









(4) Suede minimalist MA-1 bomber, great printed lining

Last but not least, a nice design and alternative to the button-front Valstarino, this MA-1 inspired bomber has a great streamlined look, uses the same soft goatskin suede as Valstarino and comes with a really cool leaf-print lining. Only available in 2 colors for pre-orders.

Click to expand...

Though I have been placing a far greater emphasis on button cuffs of late, I would always endorse a decent amount of cuffed shirts in one's wardrobes. Unless you're in a professional setting where it's a faux pas (thinking particularly if you're young and/or relatively new), I just think they're a wonderful option. To me they are just so damn elegant.

Also, with makers like Gassmann and (presumably) Barbarulo, the links are discreet enough in size that I wouldn't fret about bulk.

In summation, buy links (and many other goodies) from NMWA ",

​For next spring/summer, Stephan Schneider took his inspiration from foam. All kinds of foam!

We decided to have as much fun with this as he did, and this season's pre-order is all about paring things down into a few core styles, all available in the same selection of our favorite fabrics.

We're offering three styles of shirt: the classic plain collar button-up, the short sleeve with button-down collar, and our favorite (don't laugh!) the polo.


Spoiler: Stephan's Illustrations



  




Shirt Foam


Shirt Sponge


Polo Bubble


The fabrics include lightweight cotton poplins in the signature foamy mcfoamface colors that took the most direct inspiration from the collection: a pale yellow, a pale pink, a pale mint green, and (you guessed it) a pale blue.

  



The other options don't necessarily have as much to do with the theme of the collection, they just happen to be beautiful fabrics in their own right. There is a very cheery sherbet plaid (as I'm calling it), and two beautiful linen hopsacks: one a navy and white broken houndstooth, and the other a fine stripe in beiges and browns. My advice? The polo in the navy and white, and the long sleeve in the stripes.

 
  



So I mentioned it was going to be simple, but how simple?

Most of our customers wear one size larger in SS shirts than in knitwear and outerwear, but I unfortunately don't have measurements for these. The long sleeve shirt will be comparable to other long sleeve shirts we've had in the past though, FWIW

No, I know just the picture you mean. That fabric is a double-faced bonded cotton, that because of the nature of the way they put the two cotton fabrics together it gets almost a neoprene like quality to it. It's spongy (like foam!) but it does make for a few cool shirt. Ultimately, it's just a bit too hard to express what makes it special over a computer screen relative to the cost (very expensive) to offer it in the pre-order.

Sponge is about the same as the Sentiment, the polo is a little longer on account of the curved hem. Longer sleeve length is the same as the Sentiment, yes.

VALSTAR PRE-ORDERS SS18

(1) Suede Valstarino

No need to introduce the Valstarino blouson.  Invented by Valstar in 1935 as a civilian/city take on A1 military leather jackets, it has been copied, imitated and made all over the world.  It's a great piece that can be worn with tailored pants, jeans, a sweater, a shirt.   It just looks great on most people.  The simple lined version (not wool lining or insulation/fill) is perfect for all climates, including milder ones.   The unlined version is perfect when looking for a lighter suede jacket.

Choose lined or unlined.
Pick your color and size and get it at a great pre-order price.

 


Six colors, sizes from Eu 44 to Eu 60.  No MTM or other customization.

(2) Cotton/nylon (60/40 type) Valstarino

Finally a fabric Valstarino from the new team at Valstar.   Great pick with the 60/40 fabric, water-repellent, same fit and design as Valstarinos, same horn buttons, lighter weight travel fabric and a great value.  Three colors available for pre-orders.

Last but not least, a nice design and alternative to the button-front Valstarino, this MA-1 inspired bomber has a great streamlined look, uses the same soft goatskin suede as Valstarino and comes with a really cool leaf-print lining.  Only available in 2 colors for pre-orders.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FOUNDER EXITS EIDOS TO LAUNCH NEW BRAND

NEW YORK, July 20, 2017 -- Antonio K. Ciongoli, co-founder and Creative Director of EIDOS, announced today that he is leaving Eidos after this season to launch a forthcoming brand.



Spoiler: Spoiler



Mr. Ciongoli has led EIDOS for four and a half years, since he pitched the brand concept to Isaia Napoli, the company’s majority shareholders.  In that time, EIDOS has evolved from a small collection focused on classic tailoring to a global luxury wholesale brand that is sold in over 40 locations worldwide including Barney’s New York, Lane Crawford and Mr. Porter.

“Building Eidos has been a life-changing experience for me and I cannot thank Gianluca Isaia and Jim Shay enough for the opportunity to do so.   While moving on from anything one cares about is difficult, I am optimistic about EIDOS’ potential and I look forward to watching its future evolution,” stated Mr. Ciongoli, noting that he will stay through the end of this season and retain his equity stake in the brand thereafter.

Regarding his new project, Mr. Ciongoli said, “In the last six years I have seen the retail landscape change dramatically. The value in today’s market is the opportunity to connect directly with the people to whom our product speaks and I’m interested in creating an immersive, content-driven platform that expands that dialogue.”  Mr. Ciongoli noted that more information about his forthcoming brand will be made available weekly via his Instagram @akciongoli.

ABOUT ANTONIO K. CIONGOLI

Antonio K. Ciongoli is a creative director with over 10 years of international luxury sportswear design experience.  Most recently he has led EIDOS, a unisex global lifestyle brand he conceptualized and co-founded with Isaia Napoli in January of 2013.

Ciongoli was born and raised in Burlington, Vermont, attended St. Stephen’s School in Rome, Italy and graduated from the Annenburg School of Communication at the University of Southern California in 2006.  He began his career in fashion at Vineyard Vines, where he was hired to answer phones in their customer service center.  Within 4 months, he was managing the design of all men’s and women’s accessories and children’s clothing. In 2008, Ciongoli joined Ralph Lauren as a knitwear designer for their Rugby brand and remained there until he was tapped by American menswear designer Michael Bastian to be his deputy creative director.  During his tenure with Bastian, the label received wide critical acclaim, including two nominations and 1 win for the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s (CFDA) Menswear Designer of the Year (2011 and 2013) and GQ’s Best New Designer of the Year in 2011.

The EIDOS brand has been highlighted in many international fashion publications including WWD, GQ, Esquire, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  It is sold at over 40 luxury retail locations worldwide.

Stephan Schneider SS2018: FOAMALITIES
​For next spring/summer, Stephan Schneider took his inspiration from foam. All kinds of foam!

We decided to have as much fun with this as he did, and this season's pre-order is all about paring things down into a few core styles, all available in the same selection of our favorite fabrics.

We're offering three styles of shirt: the classic plain collar button-up, the short sleeve with button-down collar, and our favorite (don't laugh!) the polo.

The fabrics include lightweight cotton poplins in the signature foamy mcfoamface colors that took the most direct inspiration from the collection: a pale yellow, a pale pink, a pale mint green, and (you guessed it) a pale blue.

View attachment 812937 View attachment 812938 



The other options don't necessarily have as much to do with the theme of the collection, they just happen to be beautiful fabrics in their own right. There is a very cheery sherbet plaid (as I'm calling it), and two beautiful linen hopsacks: one a navy and white broken houndstooth, and the other a fine stripe in beiges and browns. My advice? The polo in the navy and white, and the long sleeve in the stripes.

I intend on wearing this jacket for warm-weather black tie, so his recommendation of fabric covered buttons made sense to me; MoP has a bit more flash to it, and draws the eye to the buttons when light glints off of it which is essentially the opposite of what I'm trying to accomplish wearing black tie.

Odd question, how is the cuff constructed? Just rolled and tacked at the inseam/outseam? I usually prefer slightly longer shorts so was wondering if I can just uncuff them myself or will it need a tailor?

Also, how is the sizing on this? Would you happen to have this season's drawstring pant for size comparison?",

I didn't really look at the fit pics but it does look longer! I'm guessing it's due to the longer rise/drop crotch.

But if we find the inseam too short, I assume we can effectively unroll the hem for ~9-9.25"" inseam? Per NMWA's roll of 4cm + 19.5cm inseam.",

EIDOS SS18 PRE-ORDERS (THE FINAL CHAPTER)

With Antonio making his exit after this season, and while we are hoping that Eidos continues to put out great designs, we will certainly miss his eye for fabrics and cuts.

This may be our last pre-orders with Eidos so take advantage if you like the NMWA cut, Sal trousers, etc...    Please note that we were asked to exclude Eidos pre-orders from our usual pre-order discount construct, so you won't be able to apply any pre-order discount (beyond SF10)

FORMAL WEAR







We find it very difficult to find good tuxedos with a nice cut and great fabrics.   Antonio does a great job there, but we cannot stock all styles and everyone has different tastes (DB shawl? peak SB? midnight? cream?) - so this is an opportunity to get the dinner suit you really want

Three jacket styles offered:

SB peak (Ciro)
SB shawl (Ciro)
DB shawl (Ciro)
View attachment 819733 View attachment 819731 View attachment 819732

Three fabrics offered

VBC midnight wool (looks pitch black in any artificial light)
Faliero Sarti black cotton/silk (light, awesome hand, impossible to capture in pics)
Tallia di Delfino cream linen/silk/cotton
Midnight wool and black cotton/silk come with black grosgrain lapel facings.  Cream linin/silk/cotton lapels are in same fabric.

Trousers sold as separates (dinner Sal model with grosgrain side tape)

Yes, no change in pattern. 

I prefer the XL on me.   I think that for people who are 52/54 like me but in good shape (good drop), then L may work well as the chest stretches a little but the waist doesn't cling to the (smaller) midsection.     For guys who are not in such great shape, linen can be a little unforgiving and cling to the wrong areas...

Ask and you shall receive. Each of the following is a large. Three crew necks and two tunics. Apparently the light blue crew neck was sitting at the bottom of the stack (prominent folds) and the grey tunic would look better with different pants, but you're not paying me to model so...

Asian Afro is right about breathability. Pique is more of an open weave. It is also more textured. Lots and lots and lots of polos are made using pique but it is rarely used for other shirts.

This particular jersey we picked with the Inglese team is a lightweight jersey.  I looked at two other qualities of Tessilmaglia jersey and they were a bit heavier.  

Jersey is just a very different feel and look for a polo shirt.  It's much softer than pique and feels less ""standard"" polo material.

Seems like the consensus  Also accounting for any shrinkage but I plan on gentle wash, hang dry, and hand press anyways so I am not too worried about laundering.
So far I am leaning towards the once-piece collar in jersey cotton (all the colors look great, hard to choose!), I like the deeper colors. Cotton pique in maroon looks nice.

Everything in general looks very nice.

Great looking jacket. Velour? Harkening back to the 70's? 

I bet a million bucks it looks awesome on you. But pics would cement my bet. 

If I'm a size 5 in the Addict sweater, Sage jacket and Scent dress shirt- which size would I be in the Period Jacket. 

The size 5 Period measurements seem good for me but the chest is 44.1"". Might that be too big? My chest is 38.5"", shoulders 18"". 

Also, would Velour/Wool lining work in S. Fl and if so, what do you think is roughly the warmest temperature the Period could be worn in.

I have this from back in January, so I'm trying on the sample size (4) here.

 

As for sizing, I would say to go with your usual size. I just tried on my 4 again and I like the fit, and I'm a typical US Small / 36

Regarding temps, I know this comes up a bunch in the winter but it's up to you - it's a pretty standard weight velour, and the wool lining is only across the upper back, and along the front.

Not the same fit as those were garment-dyed so they fit a bit smaller.  Non garment-dyed cotton trousers fit like the wool ones.

I typically wear Large in all IM (linen tunics, linen crew necks, original bulls wool) but have no experience with Aran knits. From the current listing alone a Large seems too trim. Having said that, I shed some 6 kilos recently, so am back to 50s Formosa territory.

If you're concerned about the warmth or if you can only wear it twice a year, I would probably steer you away from it.   If you need a jacket like that (performs well in cold weather and wearable without knit up to the 50s), then you can consider the arctic BF.  

Maybe the NR jackets with an optional liner are more adequate for your weather?  e.g. single-breasted Caban, if you're looking for something not too long",

From the preorder photos, this is the exact color way - which NMWA didn't stock:













Only problem, as does happen with preorders is that these really did come up small. I ordered a Large which has always been perfect in Inis Meain for me, but it fits one size small for sure.

Anyone here happen to order an Extra Large and lose a lot of weight since March and want to trade?

Here are the measurements for the same sweater in a different color way that Nmwa is stocking:

I think it may have been some sort of herringbone?

I was right on the herringbone - I got an olive green herringbone. I forget the exact name of the shade. The jacket is phenomenally awesome (the fit is perfect and that's something I always worry about with pre-orders) and seems incredibly warm for its weight. I do sort of wish I had ordered a brighter color though but that's just a thought I had as I went to hang it up and realized nearly every jacket I own is some shade of brown, green, or navy.

It was just under 50º here in Metro Detroit this morning and I debated between wearing my new Bumfreezer or my MA-1 flight jacket on the way to work this morning. I opted for the flight jacket since I drive a Jeep and had the top off and a cool morning and topless car seems like the perfect situation for a flight jacket but I sort of wish I had gone with the Bumfreezer.

I feel like I am always running a bit warm so I don't know if I will wear my Bumfreezer much until the temps are consistently a bit lower. It does seem pretty warm for its weight. I think around 50 would probably be my max with it. The temps are supposed to be around 45º on my way to work the next few days so maybe I'll try the Bumfreezer tomorrow.",

Yes, but because of fabric limitations (he works with small mills in Germany) we'll have a limited supply of the navy ones, and none of the taupe ones. That said, he was able to source another fabric that is similar to the taupe but a slightly darker brown, so we'll have a small run of those as well.

That's no longer part of their range.

I'd been thinking of adding a Mackintosh raincoat to my collection, although part of that might have been motivated by a subconscious checklist of ""must-own"" menswear items (Barbour Bedale, white CPs, etc). If they are just raising prices to look better I guess I should avoid the label.

I received my preordered Inis Meain New Aran Sweater from NMWA a few days ago. Amazing!

It's the Navy/Purple Wool & Cashmere:













Only problem, as does happen with preorders is that these really did come up small. I ordered a Large which has always been perfect in Inis Meain for me, but it fits one size small for sure. 

Here are the measurements for the same sweater in a different colorway that NMWA is stocking:

http://www.nomanwalksalone.com/index.php/brown-orange-wool-cashmere-new-aran-fisherman-sweater.html
Unfortunately No Man isn't stocking this color way, or I'd have been able to exchange it for an XL (kind folk over there!).

Anyhow, Greg was gracious as always and suggested I post it here in their NMWA thread to see if someone might want to pick it up who missed out...

Just wanting to get what I paid for it on preorder: $595 - 20% = $476 (USD) and I'll include shipping by Canada Post to Canada or USA. (FYI, as Greg pointed out to me, another retailer did pick this colorway up and is selling for $795...)

Hit me up if you're interested!

""I want to make something that could exist in men’s wardrobe but doesn’t exist yet. Nothing extraordinary or innovative in designs but rather something ordinary and sensible.

Short answer: It is very, very similar, although I can't say if it is exactly the same.

Long Answer: It's from the same mill, and felt the same at a cursory glance, but I don't have the exact specifications. I have also shipped out the small handful of taupe ones we had so I can't compare again.

Everyone frequenting this thread already knows how thoughtfully curated the offerings are from NMWA, so let me get to the point:

I wanted to give a hearty shout-out to Kyle and Greg for their responsive customer service. Whenever I order anything from NMWA, I receive a prompt shipping notice that never takes more than a day to get to me. What's more, the shipping process typically takes no more than 24 hours beyond that here in NJ.

I tried on the Valstar in a size 46 and realized that I would have preferred a slightly roomier size for the sake of fall layering. I was on the phone with Kyle at noontime yesterday and he very helpfully agreed to set aside a larger size for me. I sent him an e-mail confirming my sending the 46 back to him from my local UPS Store and just this afternoon, less than a day after our initial conversation, I have in my inbox a shipping notice for the larger sized Valstar (slated to arrive by day's end tomorrow).

The only work left is to find a new and creative way of justifying another outerwear purchase at the spousal customs station tomorrow night. Thanks, Kyle and Greg and the rest of the NMWA staff!",8.0

i'm def not an expert and am a junior associate in this dept.  because i will say based on my experience, YEMV.  my fiance, soon to be wife in less than 3 weeks, would laugh in my face as she took all my credit cards and threw them in the trash can after cutting them in a millions pieces

what i do instead is mail all packages to my office.  if asked, i say ""what, this old thing?  oh i've had this in storage and forgot i had it"".  again YEMV lol",

Yep.

A lot less bulky knit lining (very easy to close and button).  Lining is not removable, neither is the hood.   Faux flap pockets with real side entry pockets. Ribbed cuffs under the regular cuffs.  Full quilted lining.

What's your opinion about treating the suede on the Valstarino? A must or am I being too careful? I used to treat all of my new Alden and Viberg suede footwear with Tarrago Nano Protector, but I honestly don't re-apply regularly anymore and haven't noticed problems when I've worn such footwear in light to moderate rains. I'm not too worried about discoloration, as the jacket is already a dark brown shade. Should I just wear it untreated or play it conservatively in the event of a sudden downpour? Thanks for any help you can offer.",

Big chocolate trouser fan here. Navy is great, but also lighter shades. Not crazy about gray unless there is some brown in there. What is less obvious but really great is sand/khaki/beige/olive type colors in knitwear and jackets. I tend to prefer light blue shirts with brown trousers. Chambray is usually very nice. As for shoes, sand suede is usually a hit, as is tobacco suede (although not a personal favorite because I prefer more muted color schemes). Brown leather sneakers are also great.",

""All season"" is a trick concept.  Means very different things if you live in Los Angeles or Chicago

We don't have a plain solid navy sport coat this season.  The closest to that for fall is an Eidos one, with a slight birdseye/donegal effect, but softer, more subtle, and lighter than a donegal tweed.

I found, like seemingly most others in this thread, that you need to size up one.  I needed a 52 and I typically wear 50 for most jackets.

Also, for those on the fence with Norwegian Rain, more praise from me.  I bought the bumfreezer last year, and it is unbelievable.  I am thinking about buying another, in a size up, just to have two.

The materials, construction, and styling are top notch.  The NR stuff reminds me a little bit of that sexy, unobtainable Loro Piana storm system gear that retails for $4,000 - except the NR stuff is (in my opinion) better styled, and about $3,000+ less expensive.  NR serves a niche that is not serviced by anyone, and it feels like you are getting a lot  of value for your money",5.0
gdl203,"Oct 3, 2017",6:52 AM,9026728,"Agreed.  For a while I was a little hung up on heritage and natural materials, sticking with Mackintosh knowing that the raincoats are technically terrible (objectively - they trap moisture in).   Meeting T-Michael and realizing how much tailoring and design work is going into the NR coats, all the incredible details and the custom woven technical fabrics, was just what I needed to see the light.   The product is just so much better, the designs are impeccable and the value is impossible to beat for something that well made, in small series, with such great materials.  

The modularity is also really cool, and something that I think is very much within the NoMan spirit : you can be CBD dressed for a meeting on a Thursday and want something cooler and more contemporary on Saturday.   Some of the NR coats will do all that for you.

			The Inis Meain Leder sweaters are sweaters you wear to become a man. A sweater that you put on and go out and do an honest day of work in. They are not precious and not meant to be washed with your delicates. They should smell like sweat and oil, semen and earth. These are the sweaters of Bull McCabe and Quint. Sweaters that leave on when you take your woman.

I swear to god, if I see one of you at a Bergdorf party wearing one of these sweaters and huddled in a corner fearing a waiter bumping into you with a tray of champagne I will throw you out a fucking window.

Yes, most likely L in crewneck and M in the cardigan jacket. I would recommend checking the length on them though, as the crewneck runs short.

Hi 
Ultimately I was able to place an order with Amazon payments HOWEVER I do maintain there is something wrong with the authorization system your website utilizes.  I was on the telephone with American Express while attempting my order multiple times.  They confirmed that my multiple shipping and billing address were in the system - and each time American Express actually issued authorization - you might find that NMWA has received quite a bit of money from me multiple times!!  Don't spend it all at once!

The issue is not on AMEX's end as they have authorized but rather on the third party's end.  Feel free to PM me or have someone telephone on Monday for further explanation - and reimbursement of my multiple purchases.

Either way, if the Amazon payment system and a confirmation email from NMWA is to be believed, a size Large Leder Taupe Great Coat should be reserved for ME.  Excited to try it as I missed out by one day two years ago.",

No that's a different fabric - the asymmetrical jacket is cotton/wool and a bit lighter and more textured than the 100% wool of the Thomas bombers",

Already dropped off to the Wazin tailor in NYC for alterations of sleeve and taking in the sides. Attaching the pic when I tried on the jacket and also some iPhone quality pics which don’t do the jacket any justice. Would appreciate any feedback regarding the fit.

Click to expand...

To each their own, obviously, but there's a risk of being penny-wise, pound-foolish there.
I've had bad experiences in the past figuring ""hey, it's just hemming"" and going to a random dry cleaner rather than my regular tailor because I was being lazy/impatient/cheap/whatever.  The last time I did that they they neglected to cuff the hem, despite my having asked for cuffs, specified the length of the cuffs, and then confirmed the request when the ticket was being written up.  I've had at least one similar experience in the past.  I don't live in NY so I don't know what Wazin charges, and there's obviously a point at which price is a legitimate consideration.  But do they really charge so much for a simple hem job that the price difference is material (forgive the pun) to the price of the trousers?",

I tried it on in the shop back in September. I think it qualifies as not bulky and light. I also have the alpaca/silk crewneck from last year (the year before?). The knitting isn't the same between the two. I think the rollneck is more closed so should be warmer. The blend itself I would rate as less warm than the wool/cashmere blend from IM, for example.",

			I thought it would be cute - and in the spirit of celebration - to add up my ""contributions"" to NMWA over the years.  For those around since the beginning:  I would recommend not doing so.  Out of shame, I stopped after the first three (of a total of EIGHT) pages.  I then deleted the Excel spreadsheet I started.

With that said, my outerwear game is on point, and I have a lot of awesome stuff.  And out of everything that I have purchased, I believe I have only re-sold two items because they were ""not for me.""  That is a pretty impressive ratio, if I do say so myself.

Click to expand...

I’m a 4 in the TSS quilted blazer and a 52/XL in recent F/W RO Intarsia and Scuba leathers. I initially tried a 40 in the black horse Manila and thought it was a bit snug in the chest and upper arms, but I could probably swing it if I planned to wear it open and with a tee or equivalent thin layer underneath. I ultimately went with the 42 for just a bit more room.  Still nicely fitted, but I can close the 42 comfortably and fit a medium weight layer underneath. Super nice piece, as is customary for NMWA.",

Mine may be an anomaly because I haven’t been able to fit into a ‘medium’ anything since high school.  For your reference, I measure about 45” chest, 16.5” arms, 35” waist and have plenty of room to spare.

Thankfully NMWA offers free shipping both ways...Might as well buy both sizes and return what doesn’t fit.",
